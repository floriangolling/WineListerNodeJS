# WineListerNodeJS

First try of app website using NodeJS, Express, Flash, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, VueJS, Pug(Jade), ASCSS.

The code architecture isnt clean, and i'll try to improve it, but i'm still learning of to cut off parts of my website code,
Everything's working pretty fine, and this website's goal is to manage your wine stock, from a website, and the second goal is to post every week's summary of my
web learning experience in reymann.
